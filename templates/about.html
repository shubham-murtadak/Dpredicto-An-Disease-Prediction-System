                <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urinating often.</li>
                    <li>Feeling very thirsty.</li>
                    <li>Extreme fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Blurry vision.</li>

                <p>Heart desease is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>
